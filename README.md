# DSDHT: Data Science for Drug Discovery, Health, and Translational Medicine

![I590 Banner](images/I590banner.png)

INFO_I-590, "Topics in Informatics: Data Science for Drug Discovery,
Health and Translational Medicine". This innovative data science course
was developed and introduced by Professor David Wild in 2013, with major contributions by
Associate Instructor Abhik Seal.  For 2017 the course was significantly revised, by 
Professor Joanne Luciano, assisted by Associate Instructors Jeremy Yang and JT Wolohan.

This major revision included a re-conception of the course, which had previously
concentrated on drug discovery, and particularly bioinformatics and cheminformatics, to
expand the health and medical units, and to serve a diverse student population, generally
of two types, either more computationally skilled, or more application and domain
oriented.  More concretely, a student in the former category might have strong programming
and CS skills, and a student in the latter category might have a strong background in
medical or health informatics, but limited programming skills.  Jeremy's role included
condensing and updating the previous content on drug discovery to 4 weeks, while Joanne
focused on expanding and enriching the previous content on health and medical topics.
This was a challenging task, started in late November 2016, to be completed for the Spring
2017 edition of the course.  We were assisted by instructional designers and online
technology specialists, which was very helpful, but required the coordination of a complex
team effort.  The resulting Spring 2017 edition of DSDHT was quite successful in many
respects.  After an introductory unit: "Introduction to Data Science and the Healthcare
Ecosystem," the original three driving questions were retained:

 - __How can data science help researchers find new drugs and reuse old ones?__
 - __How can data science help providers treat patients better?__
 - __How can data science help us all lead healthier lives?__

These three units organized the domain knowledge, linked by foundational life sciences,
but also all addressable by the methods and tools of data science.  In this way a
profoundly vast and diverse knowledge domain was organized and related to data science,
with specific, concrete examples and exercises informed by the academic and commercial
experiences of the instructors.  DSDHT was offered again in Fall 2017, with minor
revisions, mostly to achieve more effective and consistent use of the online learning
management system (LMS) Canvas.  One notable feature of DSDHT was the final projects,
which involved a process of proposals and refinement, and presentation via report and a
"virtual poster session."  These projects were modeled after scholarly or professional
research studies.  Several have potential as publishable research, and are available as
exemplars by consent of the students.
